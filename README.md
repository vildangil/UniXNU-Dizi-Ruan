# UniXNU Dizi / Ruan

Experimental [UniXNU](https://github.com/UniXNU/UniXNU) port for Xiaomi Redmi Pad Pro (`dizi`, Snapdragon SM7435). The `ruan` variant is not separately verified.

**Current stage:** EDK2 and the UniXNU graphical menu start on dizi using temporary `fastboot boot`. The payload is still not mounted: the FDT initrd buffer starts with LZ4 Legacy magic `0x184C2102`. XNU kernel entry, storage, GPU and iPadOS userland are not verified.

## Ownership

- **Device repository (this repo):** `board.toml`, defconfig, DTS, device evidence, eventual device drivers and boot profile.
- **[Mu-Silicium](https://github.com/vildangil/Mu-Silicium):** EDK2, BootShim, firmware configuration and PMIC/SPMI.
- **[UniXNU](https://github.com/UniXNU/UniXNU):** generic boot manager, DarwinBoot and shared components.

The checkout was initially derived from `UniXNU-sheng` (SM8550). Its drivers, MMIO values, firmware and iPadOS-specific settings must not be used on SM7435. Cleanup is required before native builds. The previous Dizi experiments and temporary images are in [dizi_IpadOS_maybe](https://github.com/vildangil/dizi_IpadOS_maybe).

## Next milestones

1. Correctly expose a raw FAT32 payload to UniXNU across the LZ4/initrd handoff.
2. Load `EFI/UniXNU/unixnu.toml`, then verify XNU handoff and capture kernel logs.
3. Validate an SM7435 SoC source, firmware memory map, ADT and OS identity before enabling native builds.
4. Verify `ruan` independently.

Follow the [official device repository specification](https://unixnu.com/porting/device-repository) and [porting steps](https://unixnu.com/porting/steps). Do not flash experimental images into Android partitions.
